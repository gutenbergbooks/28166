<h2><small>INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS<br />

CUSTOM MARK III<br />

CP SERIES OIL FIRED UNIT</small></h2>


<p><span class="u">GENERAL</span></p>

<p>The Custom Mark III CP Series Oil Fired Unit is a high quality heating
unit that will provide many years of comfortable and economical heat if
properly installed and given proper care. It is <span class="u">IMPORTANT</span> therefore that
these instructions should be followed carefully.</p>


<p><span class="u">SHIPMENT</span></p>

<p>The unit is completely assembled at the factory except for the following
parts which are packed in a separate carton and strapped to the skids
inside the shipping carton:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 - 3/4" × Close Steel Nipple</li>
<li>1 - 3/4" × 3/4" × 1/2" Tee</li>
<li>1 - Fig. 105 Tridicator</li>
<li>1 - 3/4" No. 10-402-05 ASME Relief Valve</li>
<li>1 - 3/4" No. 600-19 Boiler Drain</li>
<li>1 - T87F-2055 Thermostat</li>
</ul>


<p>The jacket extension for 128CPO is shipped in separate carton.</p>


<p><span class="u">DAMAGE IN TRANSIT</span></p>

<p>Upon receipt of shipment of this material, inspect all cartons for
external damage. If external damage is noted, open the carton and
inspect for damage to equipment. Mark the number of cartons received in
this condition on the delivering carrier's waybill, and request the
services of their inspector.</p>

<p>If, upon opening a carton, concealed damage is discovered, open the
entire shipment and note all equipment so damaged. Contact the
delivering carrier and request inspection of the damaged equipment. Do
not destroy the carton. The inspector from the freight company will need
this to determine reason for damage.</p>

<p>Normally claims for any and all damages should be filed with the freight
company within five working days after receipt of shipment.</p>

<p>All materials are sold F.O.B. Factory. It is the responsibility of the
consignee to file claim with the delivering carrier for material
received in a damaged condition.</p>


<p><span class="u">LOCATING UNIT</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><span class="u">BEFORE REMOVING SHIPPING CARTON, LOCATE UNIT IN ITS FINAL POSITION</span></span></p>

<p>The carton is plainly marked so as to indicate which is the outlet
burner end of the unit which is also the end where the return and flue
are located. Clearance should be provided in both the front and rear of
the unit for cleaning. Where possible it is good practice to locate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>unit so its sides are parallel to the chimney flue. In all instances
locate unit as near chimney flue as possible in order to avoid use of a
long flue pipe.</p>


<p><span class="u">REMOVING CARTON</span></p>

<p>Once the packaged unit is in its proper place, cut all around the carton
on the scored line as shown on carton. The entire carton may then be
lifted from the skids.</p>

<p>If it is found necessary to move the unit a little more to place it in
the exact location ready for piping, do so before removing skids.</p>

<p>DO NOT PUSH AGAINST ANY PART OF JACKET OR OIL BURNER WHEN MOVING UNIT.
TO MOVE UNIT, PUSH AGAINST <span class="u">SKIDS, FLUE BOX OR SMOKE BOX</span>. PUSHING AGAINST
JACKET WILL RESULT IN DAMAGE.</p>


<p><span class="u">REMOVING SKIDS</span></p>

<p>The skids are specially designed for easy removal. It is necessary,
however, to follow these instructions carefully.</p>

<ol class="AU"><li>After unit is in proper place, remove the two cross
pieces from skids by pulling out all scaffolding (double
headed) nails.</li>

<li>By inserting pinch bar or 2" × 4" underneath the smoke
box (rear of unit), tilt one side of unit just high enough
to lift lugs out of holes in skid, then knock skid out from
underneath unit. Then do the same thing on the other side
of unit. <span class="u">THE UNIT IS NOT BOLTED TO THE SKIDS.</span> The 3/4" lugs
welded to the unit simply fit into the 3/4" holes in the
skids.</li></ol>


<p class="center bbox">
IMPORTANT<br />
<br />
DO NOT TILT UNIT BY PUSHING AGAINST JACKET<br />
<br />
IT IS NOT NECESSARY<br />
<br />
AND BY DOING SO THE JACKET WILL BE DAMAGED<br />
</p>


<p><span class="u">LEVELING UNIT</span></p>

<p>In case floor is uneven, unit may easily be made level by inserting
shims under the 4 shipping lugs. These lugs also keep the jacket 1/2"
off the floor, protecting it from wet floors and dampness.</p>


<p><span class="u">PIPING AND WIRING</span></p>

<p>Once the unit is in its proper location with the packing carton, skids
and packing material removed, it is ready for piping and connection from
Room Thermostat and 110 V. 60 Cy. A.C. Current.</p>


<p><span class="u">CONTROL SYSTEM</span></p>

<p>The controls furnished are for a one zone Forced Water System consisting
of T87F Room Thermostat, L8124A-1007 Triple Acting Aquastat and
Circulator Relay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> C554A-1018 Cadmium Photocell, R8184G-1005 Burner
Relay and V4046A-1009 Oil Valve. Description and complete wiring diagram
will be found packed with each control.</p>


<p><span class="u">SPECIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS</span></p>

<p>For special control systems such as multiple installations, zone
controlled, unit heater, radiant panel, etc., write to factory for
wiring diagrams.</p>


<p><span class="u">CHIMNEY AND BREECHING REQUIREMENTS</span></p>

<p>The CP boiler should be connected to a vertical vent system that will
prevent: (1) positive pressure in the flue, (2) backward flow of flue
gas through the unit when the burner stops, and (3) condensation in the
flue.</p>

<p>Use double-walled or insulated pipe for sections of the flue in cold
areas. All outside vents, except for short extensions, must be insulated
to avoid condensation in the flue. Several types of prefabricated
chimneys are available providing double-walled or insulated pipe, some
with ceramic and others with metallic liners.</p>

<p>While the unit is equipped with an induced draft fan, proper size vent
must be provided to remove the gases of combustion. It is recommended
that a 4" to 5" increaser be used for venting the 87CPO and 108CPO and a
4" to 6" increaser be used for the 128CPO. For abnormal runs (exceeding
10 ft.), consult factory.</p>

<p>Vent and breeching must be gas tight by sealing with asbestos or
thermo-setting pressure sensitive tape.</p>


<p><span class="u">DRAFT REGULATOR</span></p>

<p>It is recommended that a draft regulator be installed in chimney flue
<span class="u">just below the flue pipe opening</span>, if the unit is attached to an
extremely high chimney; an unlined chimney; or a chimney which is
constructed on the exterior of the house.</p>


<p><span class="u">CONTROLS AND TRIM</span></p>

<p>Controls are installed in place at the Factory. Attach thermo-altimeter
in 1/2" tapping in top front of boiler. Install 3/4" × close nipple in
3/4" top connection with 3/4" × 3/4" × 1/2" Tee. 3/4" Tee opening for
installation of the relief valve and 1/2" opening for expansion tank.</p>


<p><span class="u">WIRING</span></p>

<p>Controls are all in place and wired at the factory except connection to
circulator.</p>


<p><span class="u">REGULATING OIL PRESSURE</span></p>

<p>Standard nozzles furnished with the burner will produce the stamped
rated capacity when used with Commercial Standard No. 2 Fuel Oil, and
operated with a pressure of 100 lbs. per square inch. The standard
setting of the fuel unit is 100 lbs. Due to difference in tank
elevations, the pressure should be adjusted at the time of start up.</p>


<p><span class="u">FUEL LINES</span></p>

<p>Care should be employed when attaching the oil lines to the fuel unit.
Overtightening or twisting will twist the pump-motor mounting plate and
put a stress on the motor bearings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="u">START UP PROCEDURE</span></p>

<p>General:</p>

<ol><li>Make certain that correct voltage has been supplied to
motor and control circuit.</li>

<li>Insure that outside air openings are provided in the
boiler room for ventilation, and for admission of air for
combustion. The free area of such openings should not be
less than 7 square inch opening per 100,000 Btuh burner
input, or more as required by local codes.</li>

<li>Check to see that flue, wiring and water level are in
order.</li>

<li>Start burner fan motor to prime pump. If pump does not
pick up oil within a few minutes, prime the pump with
lubricating oil. Do not allow pump to run more than a few
minutes without additional lubrication.</li>

<li>Check oil pressure and adjust if necessary. (See
REGULATING OIL PRESSURE).</li>

<li>Set air shutters. (See ADJUSTING BURNER) Refer to Figure
1.</li>

<li>Generously lubricate the front motor bearing with SAE #20
oil.</li></ol>


<p><span class="u">ADJUSTING BURNER</span> (See Figure 1)</p>

<p>Positioning of the nozzle in relation to the face of the cone and the
electrodes in relation to the nozzle are very important, also the face
of the cone in relation to the face of the choke ring must be set
according to the chart for each rate.</p>

<p>If the air shutter openings are too large the oil may not ignite.</p>

<ol><li>This setting will vary somewhat depending upon the grade
of oil being used or if No. 1 is used instead of No. 2.</li>

<li>The approximate burner air setting may be determined by
observing the fire through the observation port on the front
of the boiler. If the flame is smoky, the air shutter should
be opened until the fire burns clean, without any trace of
smoke. The flame should be bright yellow in color with the
tips of the flame turning orange. If the flame is too white,
reduce the amount of air admitted; and, if too red or smoky
increase the air.</li>

<li>Final adjustments should be made using a flue gas
analyzer to measure the CO<sub>2</sub> content of the flue gas and a
Bacharach model smoke meter or equivalent to determine the
amount of smoke (not to exceed a "TRACE").</li>

<li class="lsoff">For checking efficiency only the stack temperature and CO<sub>2</sub>
may be taken immediately after the fan and refer to the
standard efficiency charts for the results. Readings of 5 to
8% taken after the fan correspond to 10 to 12% taken in the
rear uptake of the boiler.</li>

<li class="lsoff">The reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> reading in the flue is caused by the
air being drawn in around the motor shaft for cooling
purposes. The motor cooling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> air is at ambient temperature
and, therefore, does not add energy to or subtract energy
from the flue gas analysis, it only adds volume to the flue
gas. Therefore, applying this data to standard efficiency
charts will give a true indication of flue gas loss.</li></ol>

<p class="center bbox">
NOTE<br />
<br />
Final adjustment should be made after
the burner has been firing continuously
for at least 10 minutes, as the fan pulls
less air when the flue gases are hot.<br />
</p>


<p>A. CHECK LIMIT CONTROL</p>

<ul><li>Run the burner long enough to bring the water temperature up to at least
190 degrees then turn the limit control setting until the burner stops.</li></ul>

<p class="center bbox">
NOTE<br />
<br />
The Minimum limit setting for any hot water
boiler should be 140 degrees F. in order to
prevent corrosion of the flues on the fire
side. The burner should be run with the primary
control thermostat terminals jumpered and the
burner controlled directly from an aquastat
keeping the boiler hot all the time, thus
eliminating the sweating of the flues on the
fire side caused by starting from a cold start.<br />
</p>


<p><span class="u">BELT ADJUSTMENT</span></p>

<p>The proper tension on the fuel unit belt drive is set at the factory.
However, the belt should be checked periodically to see that the setting
is maintained. To check setting, first, remove the belt guard and then,
using fingers, compress the belt at a point midway between the sheaves.
The proper setting at this point measured between the outer edges of the
belt, should be between 1-3/4" and 1-7/8". If adjustment is necessary
loosen the two mounting bolts, and move the fuel unit up or down to give
the necessary belt setting. Then re-tighten the mounting bolts securely
and replace the belt guard.</p>

<p><span class="u">DOMESTIC HOT WATER</span></p>

<p>In order to obtain the rated capacity of the instantaneous domestic hot
water coil limit control should be set to maintain 200° F boiler water
temperature.</p>

<p>Flow regulator and tempering valve should be installed on all
instantaneous domestic hot water coil systems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="u">BURNER SETTING</span></p>

<p>The burner is adjusted at the factory before shipment but in case of
improper operation at some future date Figure 1 will show proper
setting. In all cases the flame retention ring should be concentric with
the choke.</p>
